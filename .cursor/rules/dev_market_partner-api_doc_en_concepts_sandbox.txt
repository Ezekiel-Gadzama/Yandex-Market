Test orders
On Yandex. Market, you can test the store and its API on test orders before you start working with real ones. You can emulate the following processes:

• making an order on behalf of the buyer — add items to the cart, choose payment methods and delivery terms;
• cancellation of the order.
Yandex. Market does not charge for such orders. And errors in working with them do not affect the checks and are not used in calculating the quality index.
To go to the debugging interface, in the merchant's office on the Market, click on the icon of your account →Settingsand in the menu on the left, selectAPIs and modules→Test order.
All orders created in the debugging interface are sent to the store with the valuetruethe parameterfake, which allows the store to distinguish such orders from the real ones.
