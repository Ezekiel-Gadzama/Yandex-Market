Authorization using an OAuth token We do not recommend using an OAuth token, as this authorization method is outdated.
You can use the already generated token until the end of its validity period or create API-Key- a token.How to do it

Creating and using an OAuth token
The OAuth 2.0 protocol is used for authorization. To work with Yandex.Market via the API:

• Create an application on the oauth website.yandex.ru. If you already have an app with accessmarket:partner-api, you don't need to create a new one — You can use one for all stores and business accounts.

market:partner-api
• Create a token in the name of an employee who has access to the store's data.
• Insert the token into the headers of Market requests.

Create a token
After creating the application, you need to get a token. Is it possible to use an account other than the one used to create the app to receive the token?
May. It must also meet the same requirements. If the Yandex ID for which the token is issued loses access to the business, the API will stop working.

Insert the received token into the headerAuthorizationaccording to the following scheme:

Authorization

Authorization: Bearer <token>

Authorization: Bearer <token>
As a result, the title will look like this:

Authorization: Bearer y0_BfRRRRRV2L8sWWvNkSNNNNSrLHaNXg4cCMswFbL6MWab9lktL2KPsMw

Authorization: Bearer y0_BfRRRRRV2L8sWWvNkSNNNNSrLHaNXg4cCMswFbL6MWab9lktL2KPsMw

If the request is received without a header with a valid token, the Market returns an error.401 Unauthorized.
