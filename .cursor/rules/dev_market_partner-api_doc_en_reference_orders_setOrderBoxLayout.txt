• send the labeling codes for the products to the Market;
• remove an item from the order if it is not in stock.

⚠️ One box cannot contain both the whole goods and parts of the goods. Labeling of goods in the system«Честный ЗНАК»optional for orders from individuals

If the product is traveling in several boxes, the labeling code must be transmitted for each of them.
If you work according to the model FBS, EXPRESS
