How method versioning works
The version refers to a specific method. Different methods may have different current versions (for example, one — v1, other — v3).

Examples of the same method in different versions

GET https://api.partner.market.yandex.ru/v1/campaigns
GET https://api.partner.market.yandex.ru/v2/campaigns

GET https://api.partner.market.yandex.ru/v1/campaigns
GET https://api.partner.market.yandex.ru/v2/campaigns

Herev1andv2— versions of the same method.../campaigns. They may differ in the composition of fields, validation rules, and available parameters.

v2

.../campaigns Note Method versionGET /v1/campaignsremoved from support and unavailable.

GET /v1/campaigns

How to select and fix a version

• Open the page of the required method in the documentation — it shows the current version and the status of the previous ones.
• Fix a specific version in the client and URL (do not use the "latest by default").
• Keep track of announcements about new versions and plans to decommission old ones on the method page.

Migration between versions

• Examine the changes on the method page (what was added/changed/deleted).
• Update the request/response schema and parameters for the new version.
• Test your changes.
• Switch the version to URL to a new one.
• Monitor errors and metrics; if necessary, temporarily switch back to the previous version.
