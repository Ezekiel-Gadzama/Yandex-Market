Response format
Yandex Market API returns UTF-8 encoded responses for sellers. Responses can only be in JSON format.
To set the response format, specify in URL request the selected format after the method name. For example, as a result of executing the following query, you will receive a list of products in the catalog in JSON format:

GET https://api.partner.market.yandex.ru/v2/campaigns/{campaignId}/offer-mapping-entries.json

GET https://api.partner.market.yandex.ru/v2/campaigns/{campaignId}/offer-mapping-entries.json

You can also specify the response format when calling methods using the HTTP header.Accept. Possible header value:application/json.

Some Market systems remove spaces at the beginning and end of a line. For example, the string" example "can be saved as"example".

"example"
If you have lines with such spaces, consider this feature. For example, remove spaces before passing lines to Yandex.Market and before data reconciliation.
