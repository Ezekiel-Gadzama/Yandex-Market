Working with a sales boost
You can use the API to launch a sales boost — create and enable a single campaign for all business account stores, add products to it and set bids for them. Manage such a campaign — add, update, delete, and receive bids on products — you can only use the API.
You can make other changes to the campaign created via the API in the dashboard:

• Disable or enable the campaign.
• Change its name.
• Disable or enable the pricing strategy. Read more about the pricing strategy inYandex.Market Help for sellers.
You will not be able to manage the campaigns that you created in your account via the API.

How to get the recommended rates
To find out the recommended rates, make a requestPOST v2/businesses/{businessId}/bids/recommendations.

How to create a campaign
Send information about the products (SKU) and their bids using a queryPUT v2/businesses/{businessId}/bids. A new campaign is created the first time a request is used, or when it is repeated if you deleted a previously created campaign through the API in your account.

How to get the set rates
To find out the values of the bids set via the API, make a requestPOST v2/businesses/{businessId}/bids/info.
You will not be able to get information on campaigns created in the cabinet.
The response returns only the values of the rates that you set through the request.PUT v2/businesses/{businessId}/bids.

How to change campaign data
You can update bids, add or remove products from a campaign created via the API using a request.PUT v2/businesses/{businessId}/bids. You can perform several actions in one request. — for example, add new products to the campaign and delete the old ones.

Update bids
To update the bids for the products in the created campaign, make a requestPUT v2/businesses/{businessId}/bids, where pass the new bid values.

Add new products to the campaign
To add new products to the campaign, make a requestPUT v2/businesses/{businessId}/bids, where to send information about new products (SKU) and their bids.

Remove products from the campaign
To stop the promotion of certain products, make a requestPUT v2/businesses/{businessId}/bids, where pass the zero bid in the fieldbidfor those products that need to be removed from the campaign.
