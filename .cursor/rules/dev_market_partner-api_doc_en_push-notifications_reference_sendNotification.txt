Receiving notifications
The market sends notifications about events to the store:

• creating a new order;
• order modification;
• order status change;
• create a new chat with the customer;
• adding a new message in the chat;
• the beginning of a dispute;
• the end of the dispute;
• creating a new product review;
• creating a new review comment;
• creating an order cancellation request;
• cancellation of the order;
• creating a new non-purchase or refund;
• changing the non-purchase or refund status.
Keep these features in mind when working with notifications.

• Yandex.Market can send multiple notifications for the same event.In some cases, this is normal behavior. For example, there may be several notifications with a change in the order status due to the search for a courier.
