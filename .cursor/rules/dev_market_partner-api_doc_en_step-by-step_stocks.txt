Transfer of balances via API
In order for the Market to receive up-to-date information about balances, use the methodPUT v2/campaigns/{campaignId}/offers/stocks.

What needs to be ready before you get started
Before setting up order processing via the API, you need to add products to the Market and set up assortment updates. You don't have to do this through the API. — choose any method that is convenient for you. All the necessary instructions are available inYandex.Market Help for sellers.

How does the transfer of leftovers work?
It is important for Yandex.Market to know how many items are left in the store's warehouse. — otherwise, it may turn out that the buyer places an order, but the product does not turn out to be there. The only exception — model FBY because the goods are stored in the Market's warehouse and he can count them himself.
To transfer the leftovers correctly, be sure to readan article in the Help of the Market for sellers. All the general rules for transferring balances apply to the API too.

What number should I send

Event | Changing balances
10 units of new goods were brought to the warehouse | 0 → 10
The buyer ordered 2 units on the Market | 10 → 8
The supplier brought 10 more pieces. | 8 → 18
