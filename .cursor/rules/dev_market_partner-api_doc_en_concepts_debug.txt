Unique request ID
The market transmits a unique request identifier in the [tracepaint] header(*traceparent):

• the response, if it is a request from the store to the Market.
• the request itself in the case of API notifications, when the Market sends a request to the store.How to work with notifications
Example of a request or response header:

Content-Type: application/json
traceparent: 00-8b05ba11f1d37f7cfce0eac1a5230600-8b23fad39202f968-01
