API notifications are not related to push-api — the old scheme of working with Yandex. Market.

How to work with notifications
You can enable API notifications and Yandex.Market will send you a request.POST notificationwith information aboutthe eventevery time it happens.
This is an optional integration, you don't have to enable notifications. However, with their help, you will be able to quickly respond to changes in orders, non-purchases and refunds, as well as to requests for cancellation of the order.
The market exchanges data only with stores that operate over HTTPS using an SSL certificate. It must be signed by an official certification authority, a self-signed certificate will not work. Information about certification authorities can be found on the Internet.
Check each request against IP address ranges.
The security of your integration depends on it. — this way you will make sure that the request came from Yandex.Market.
Ranges of IP addresses used by the Market:

• 5.45.207.0/25
• 141.8.142.0/25
• 5.255.253.0/25
